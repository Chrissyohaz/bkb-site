            be able to choose exactly the services you need, rather than pay for work that you may not require.</p>

                <h5 class="service-name">When to choose a Gear service</h5>
                <p>Servicing your gears is a bit like a car service, if it is done regularly it will reduce wear and
                    tear and ensure that your bike runs smoothly for longer. The staff in our stores will be able to
                    advise you in detail, but in general we would recommend you choose a Gear Service:</p>
                <p>If the gears on your bike are not working properly</p>
                <p>If the chain is slipping, rusty or stiff</p>
                <p>After winter to ensure that your bike is restored and ready for spring</p>
                <p>At least once per year to reduce wear and tear and improve lifespan</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-info">
                <h5 class="service-name">When to choose a Brake service</h5>
                <p>Our Brake Service is great value for a reason – we think that getting your brakes checked regularly
                    is really important to keep your bike safe. The staff in our stores will be able to advise you in
                    detail, but in general we would recommend you choose a Brake Service:</p>
                <p>If your brakes lack stopping power</p>
                <p>If your brakes feel spongy, rough or soft</p>
                <p>If your brakes are making excessive noise</p>
                <p>At least once per year to ensure they are safe</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-info">
                <h5 class="service-name">When to choose a Wheel service</h5>
                <p>As the main contact point with the road or trail, the wheels really take the brunt of the terrain. Be
                    it potholes, roots or just everyday use, it is common for wheels to lose spoke tension, snap spokes
                    or for hubs to stop spinning smoothly. The staff in the store will be able to advise you in detail,
                    but we would generally recommend you choose a Wheel Service:</p>
                <p>If your spokes feel loose, you have some broken spokes, or your brakes are rubbing intermittently</p>
                <p>If your hubs feel rough or there is play in the wheel itself</p>
                <p>After winter to ensure that your bike is restored and ready for spring</p>
                <p>At least every 12-18 Months</p>
